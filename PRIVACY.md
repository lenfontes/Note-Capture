# Privacy Policy for NoteCapture

Effective Date: 1/1/2025

NoteCapture by Boomfont (developed by Len Fontes) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our Chrome extension.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Authentication Information

We collect temporary OAuth 2.0 tokens to authenticate your Google account and securely access Google Docs. These tokens are not stored permanently and are used solely to facilitate the extension's functionality.

### Website Content

When you highlight text and choose to save it, the extension collects:
- The highlighted text
- The URL of the webpage where the text was highlighted
- Timestamp of when the note was created
- Category information (if assigned)

This data is transmitted securely to your Google Docs account and stored locally in your browser.

### Web History (Limited)

The URL of the page where you interact with the extension is collected only to:
- Provide source attribution for your saved notes
- Enable you to return to the original source

## 2. Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect:
- Personally identifiable information beyond what's needed for Google authentication
- Health or financial information
- Personal communications
- Location data
- General web history unrelated to note-taking
- User activity such as keystrokes or mouse movements outside of note capture

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information you provide to:
- Authenticate your Google account for secure access to Google Docs
- Save and organize your highlighted text and metadata
- Maintain your note categories and preferences
- Sync your notes between your browser and Google Docs

## 4. How We Protect Your Information

Your data is protected through:
- HTTPS encryption for all data transfers
- OAuth 2.0 for secure Google authentication

## 6. Data Storage

### Local Storage

- You can clear this data at any time through Chrome's extension settings

### Google Docs Integration
